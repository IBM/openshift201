# Introduction

## OpenShift 201: Learn the integrations of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud

A recent study by McKinsey & Company reveals that only 20 percent of enterprise applications have moved to the cloud. We believe that a hybrid cloud approach, built on open source and a vibrant open ecosystem, is the best way to move the remaining 80 percent.

Red Hat OpenShift represents a common platform, based on the industry-standard Kubernetes, that allows you to build on premises, on the IBM Cloud, or on any other leading cloud platform. You want freedom of choice; Red Hat OpenShift offers exactly that.

The goals of this workshop are:

* To familiarize the student with OpenShift on IBM Cloud
* To learn how to integrate OpenShift and IBM Cloud

## Architecture

1. A developer generates a starter application with IBM Cloud Developer Tools.
1. Building the application produces a Docker container image.
1. The image is pushed to a project in OpenShift cluster.
1. The application is deployed to a OpenShift cluster.
1. Users access the application.
1. A developer connects the application to a Cloudant database with Operator.
1. A developper monitors the app with LogDNA and Sysdig.

## Agenda
